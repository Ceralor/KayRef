# King Kay Ohtie Outfit Reference

As stated on the [previous page](/), please ONLY use these for the outfit! The colorations are not up-to-date for the exposed body.

## Extra Information

King Kay's outfit is fused to him, like a parade balloon, so his outfit stretches and distorts with him. You can see it below in the sort of seam-like thing, and with how his valve is "sticking out of" the outfit. No seams though in art.
