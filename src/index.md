# Kay Ohtie's Reference Sheet

Below are reference sheets for my fursona, Kay! There's a [King](/king/) folder, but as it states, please *only* use this folder for reference for the outfit. The colorations are different from my primary ref for the body, and the primary ref should be used for the body (eg, ear and tail tips).

## Important Details

- Kay's orange hair is **fluffy**, not an inflated mass. It should always be drawn as fluffy and glossy.
- Kay does **not** have any seams on his body, effectively making him a single piece of latex. His colors blend slightly into eachother at the borders, unlike most latex.
- Handpaws and feetpaws have finger/toe pads, palm/sole pads, and toe/finger-tip claws. **These are not painted features, and should not be drawn flat.**
- Rubbery creases and folds are a normal thing with how soft and stretchy his hide is, deforming easily around obstacles and features. It would not be uncommon to see his feetpaws compress slightly against the ground when taking a step.

## Reference Images

The refsheets below are both by [Brennan/KindOfABigSeal](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/brennanhalls) whom you should *definitely* look at commissioning for anything lorge.
